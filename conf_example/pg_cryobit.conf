## An example configuration file for pg_cryobit
## Look for data_directory in your postgresql.conf 
data_directory /path/to/postgresql/data_directory

## This is optional. Will use current working directory is not present.
#snapshooter_dir /path/to/where/you/want/your/snapshots/to/be/build

## This is mandatory. pg_cryobit MUST be able to
## connect to your database using this string.

## The user specified MUST be a Postgresql super user. Typically 'postgres'

## If you intend to run pg_cryobit as the 'postgres' user on a default postgres install
## over unix sockets, the dsn could be as simple as:
## dsn "dbi:Pg:dbname=postgres;port=5433;user=postgres"

## If you want to run as a user and connect over IP:
## dsn "dbi:Pg:dbname=PGDATABASE;host=PGHOST;port=PGPORT;user=PGUSER;password=PGPASSWORD"

## Valid options include:
## 
#  Parameter  Environment Variable  Default
#  ---------  --------------------  --------------
#  dbname     PGDATABASE            current userid
#  host       PGHOST                localhost
#  port       PGPORT                5432
#  options    PGOPTIONS             ""
#  tty        PGTTY                 ""
#  user       PGUSER                current userid
#  password   PGPASSWORD            ""

## This is mandatory
